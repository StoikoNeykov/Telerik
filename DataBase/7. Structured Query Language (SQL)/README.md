## Structured Query Language (SQL)
### _Homework_

1.	_What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands._
        Structured Query Language is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
        The Data Manipulation Language (DML) is the subset of SQL used to add, update and delete data: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
        The Data Definition Language (DDL) manages table and index structure. The most basic items of DDL are the CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, DROP and TRUNCATE statements:
2.	_What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?_
        Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension to the SQL (Structured Query Language) used to interact with relational databases.
        T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural programming, local variables, various support functions for string processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE and UPDATE statements.
        Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface of the application.
